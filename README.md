# Encryption-from-scratch
Out of personal interest. Absolutely no security guarantees. I did not know how encryption algorithms worked and decided to have a crack at it. I would call this a fairly succesful attempt at hasing and symmetric encryption, though it still has some room for optimizing which I will get around to at some point. Non-symmetric (private/public key) encryption still eludes me. Maybe one day.
